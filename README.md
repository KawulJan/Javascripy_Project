3- JavaScript Jobs and Operations
After the object is captured through the defined event, the work and operations to be done are defined under the function blocks. 
An example function definition is “function action(){var result=x+y;}”. In order to perform the desired operations in the function,
the result is obtained by following the steps of an algorithm as follows.
1. Start.
2. Define the variables.
3. Pass values to variables.
4. Check conditions if necessary.
5. Run the loop if any.
6. Do the calculations.
7. Print the result.
8. Finish.
